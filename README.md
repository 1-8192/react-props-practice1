# react-props-practice1

- You are provided a component called Dog that is rendered inside of App
- Dog should take a prop called "name" that evaluates to a string
- Dog should append the value of its "name" prop to the DOM
- You also have a dogs.js file that will export a single dog object that looks like this:
  {
  id: 1,
  name: "Happy Slay",
  img:
  "https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/08/main/articles/082918_lh_crispr-beagles_feat_REV.jpg",
  breed: "Beagle",
  "age in human years": "21",
  "default-mood": "Happy",
  moods: { angry: "I Hate You", excited: "Excited" }
  }

Using Props and State, it is your job to figure out how to get this object into App and use it to render the dog name "Happy Slay" to the DOM
